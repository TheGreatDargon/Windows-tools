Hello, I am the creator of this "Install" batch file, which installs a number of tools i think are useful for windows.

If you are going to use this batch file you need to do a couple of things.

1. Create a folder called C:\Tools_Installers
2. Put the listed installers in this folder
3. Run the "Install.bat" file

Note: the install.bat file should be run as administrator for it to properly work. I will prompt for administrator credentials each time otherwise.

Plans for future edits to the "Install.bat" script

	- Have this create shortcuts for them. Specify folder?
	- Find more to add to the batch file.
